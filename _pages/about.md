I am an Earth scientist and geochemist, currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at ETH Zurich. I hold an MSci in Geology (2018) and a PhD in Earth Science (2022), both from Imperial College London. Following my PhD, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Natural History Museum in London (2022), and subsequently held an ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship (2023–2024).

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of geochemistry, petrology, and computational geoscience. I study the fluxes of metals and volatiles through the Earth's crust and mantle, with a particular focus on magmatic and hydrothermal processes involved in the formation of mineral deposits. I integrate tools from geochemistry, geochronology, machine learning, and geochemical/thermodynamic modelling to better understand ore-forming systems and develop methods applicable to mineral exploration.

Broad areas of interest include:

- Petrogenesis of magmas associated with ore deposits (e.g., porphyry systems)
- Applications of machine learning and computer vision in geoscience and exploration
- Geochronology of magmatic and hydrothermal systems
- Evolution and degassing of volatiles in magmatic systems
- Formation of sediment-hosted ore deposits
