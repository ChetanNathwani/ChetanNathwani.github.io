I am an Earth Scientist and geochemist and postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at ETH Zurich. I received an MSci Geology degree (2018) and a PhD (2022) from Imperial College London. I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Natural History Museum, London (2022) and then held an ETH Zurich postdoctoral Fellowship (2023-2024)

**Research Interests**

I am a geochemist, petrologist and computational geoscientist interested in understanding the fluxes of metals and volatiles in the Earth. I apply geochemistry, geochronology, machine learning and modelling approaches to track magmatic and hydrothermal processes forming mineral resources and develop tools that can be applied in mineral exploration. Broad interests incude:

- Petrogenesis of magmas related to ore deposits (e.g. porphyry deposits)
- Machine learning and computer vision applications in geoscience and mineral exploration
- Geochronology applied to magmatic and hydrothermal systems
- Evolution of volatiles in magmas
- Formation of sediment-hosted ore deposits
